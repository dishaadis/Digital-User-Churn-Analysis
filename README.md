  <h1> Digital User Churn Analysis </h1>
</p>

## Project Description
<p align="justify">
This project primarily focuses on customer churn analysis in a business context. This churn analysis is significant because it can provide an in-depth understanding of how customer behavior affects business continuity. This analysis will reveal patterns hidden behind a customer's decision to unsubscribe or transact so that the company can take appropriate preventive and retentive actions. The analysis results will provide valuable insights, which can later become the basis for formulating a more focused marketing strategy, improving the quality of customer service, and enhancing the overall customer experience. In addition to understanding aspects of customer behavior, churn analysis also aims to provide insights that can lead to developing more effective marketing strategies. The results of the churn analysis will also provide valuable information in improving customer service. This project is expected to produce concrete recommendations to help the company maintain or increase sales.
