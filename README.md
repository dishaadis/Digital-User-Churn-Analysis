  <h1> Digital User Churn Analysis </h1>
</p>

## Project Description
<p align="justify">
This project focuses on customer churn analysis in a business. Churn analysis is essential for understanding customer behaviour, identifying patterns, and implementing retention strategies. The analysis results will provide valuable insights that can be used to develop more effective marketing strategies, improve customer service, and provide a better customer experience. In addition, this project will also offer concrete recommendations that can help maintain sales or even increase sales of a business.

First, user growth is one of the most important metrics to analyze. This growth reflects the company's success in attracting and retaining new customers. In the world of eCommerce, the more engaged users indicate the attractiveness of a company and the value it offers to consumers. Analysis of user growth will involve statistical data that includes the increase in the number of new users in a certain period, customer retention, and returning user activity. From this, you can discover growth trends and customer behavior patterns that provide valuable insights for companies.

Furthermore, metrics related to product quality are an essential focus in business performance analysis. Product quality includes the physical aspects of the goods being sold and the overall customer experience in using the product. Product quality evaluation can cover aspects such as reliability, customer satisfaction, and adopting the latest technology in product development. This analysis will help companies understand how the market receives their products, whether improvements need to be made, and the level of customer satisfaction.

Finally, the payment type is also essential to business performance analysis. The effectiveness and convenience of transactions can influence the customer's buying experience. In the context of eCommerce, various payment methods, such as credit cards, bank transfers, or digital payments, can significantly impact sales conversions. Analysis of the payment type will involve evaluating the smoothness of the transaction, the level of security provided, and the customer's preference for specific methods.

Overall, this business performance analysis project for e-commerce companies has a comprehensive focus involving three main metrics: user growth, product quality, and payment types. The analysis results will provide the company with in-depth insight into areas needing improvement to succeed tremendously in this competitive market.
